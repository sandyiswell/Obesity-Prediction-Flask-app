# Obesity-Prediction-Flask-app

Deployment of obesity prediction model using Flask app

The main objective of this project is to learn Flask deployment of ML model.

Step 1: Data collection.
Data "Nutrition__Physical_Activity__and_Obesity_-_Behavioral_Risk_Factor_Surveillance_System.csv" is an open data downloaded from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spittman1248/cdc-data-nutrition-physical-activity-obesity. More details about the data can be found here.

Step 2: Preprocessing and modeling.
Preprocessing and modeling is done on Jupyter notebook. 
Model is saved using Pickle.
Note that the model made for this project is a simple one, since the main objective is to learn Flask deployment.

Step 3: Create a Conda environment with requirements.txt file.

Step 4: Flask application deployment.
Flask application is built using PyCharm. Deployment done locally.
